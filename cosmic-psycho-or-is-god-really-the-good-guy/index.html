But how credible is that narrative? Even by the book’s own light, should we believe it?</p><p id="b41c" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mw mx gd mz b gx na nb nc ha nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns fw bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Obviously, there was no one there to witness the creation, and so we just have to take the omniscient narrator’s word for it. Right?</p><p id="cfcf" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mw mx gd mz b gx na nb nc ha nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns fw bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Now, even though the Book of Genesis is not written in the first person, like the examples above, I consider God its narrator, in part because there’s a tradition of considering the Bible as having been written by humans channeling God in some way, and in part because its narrator is omniscient in a way that only really God can be in this context.</p><p id="3544" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mw mx gd mz b gx na nb nc ha nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns fw bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">That last point is important. It’s worth noting that the only possible source for the story, if this version is true, would be God himself. If you were a detective, trying to tease out the truth about what happened, and your only source has literally <em class="my">everything</em> to gain — domination of this world and the next, in this case — by getting you to believe their version of events, you should be very skeptical.</p><p id="c9f4" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mw mx gd mz b gx na nb nc ha nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns fw bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Our suspicions should be roused when someone claims to have created everything — including other beings very much like himself, from clay and bones no less — with nothing but their word to show for it. This whole story is very long on amazing claims and equally short on evidence.</p><p id="1256" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mw mx gd mz b gx na nb nc ha nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns fw bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">But do we have any evidence that he’s <em class="my">not</em> telling the whole truth? Well, the story itself is full of contradictions and unexplained details.</p><p id="7117" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mw mx gd mz b gx na nb nc ha nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns fw bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Among the more obvious ones: According to the story, Cain was <a class="af nt" href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/GEN.4.1" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">the third person</a> to ever exist (not counting god). Yet, he not only found <a class="af nt" href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/GEN.4.17" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">a wife</a>, but when he was exiled, he worried that he <a class="af nt" href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/GEN.4.14" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">would be killed by others</a>. Who? Why is this the first we hear about these people? Where did they come from, and why would they kill him?</p><p id="0c08" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mw mx gd mz b gx na nb nc ha nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns fw bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">You don’t need to answer, just acknowledge that it is natural to have questions. And with this newfound seed of skepticism, let’s go back to the story of Adam and Eve, where we see the first signs that God isn’t necessarily the moral being we’re usually told that he is.</p><h1 id="7888" class="nu nv gd bf nw nx ny gz nz oa ob hc oc od oe of og oh oi oj ok ol om on oo op bk" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="al">Is God good?</strong></h1><p id="8a3f" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mw mx gd mz b gx oq nb nc ha or ne nf ng os ni nj nk ot nm nn no ou nq nr ns fw bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">At first, Adam and Eve were innocent, and didn’t even know good from evil. They walked freely about the Garden of Eden, but God had given them a few rules. For one thing, they should not eat of the tree at the center of the garden, The Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, because “<a class="af nt" href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/GEN.2.17" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">for when you eat from it you will certainly die</a>”.</p><p id="b8fa" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mw mx gd mz b gx na nb nc ha nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns fw bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Those of us who know how this turns out, however, know that that is a lie.</p><p id="45d8" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mw mx gd mz b gx na nb nc ha nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns fw bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Soon enough, Eve and Adam both eat the fruit from the tree, but neither one dies. On the contrary, they become smarter, and capable of making better moral decisions. And when they do, God, by his own admission, feels threatened — worried that Adam and Eve will become too much like himself.</p><p id="fe49" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mw mx gd mz b gx na nb nc ha nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns fw bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">He becomes furious, and inflicts crippling punishments on Adam, Eve, the serpent, and all of their descendants for the rest of humanity’s (and serpentity’s) existence: <a class="af nt" href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/GEN.3.14" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Excruciating pain, hard labor, exile</a> …</p><p id="f6ff" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mw mx gd mz b gx na nb nc ha nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns fw bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">In Genesis, this is laid out quite matter-of-factly, but it is hard to overstate how extremely unreasonable God’s reaction is. Remember: Eve and Adam could not possibly understand that what they did was wrong, as they did not know the difference between right and wrong before eating the apple.</p><h1 id="fc24" class="nu nv gd bf nw nx ny gz nz oa ob hc oc od oe of og oh oi oj ok ol om on oo op bk" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="al">Who’s the good guy?</strong></h1><p id="9abb" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mw mx gd mz b gx oq nb nc ha or ne nf ng os ni nj nk ot nm nn no ou nq nr ns fw bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">It’s also worth noticing that the <em class="my">only</em> negative consequences of their actions were from God’s punishment.</p><p id="968a" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mw mx gd mz b gx na nb nc ha nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns fw bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Without God’s reaction, eating the apple would only have opened Adam and Eve’s eyes to the difference between good and evil, knowledge of which is self-evidently good if you want good to prevail. God’s rule that Adam and Even didn’t eat from the tree, was arbitrary all along, and only served to keep them amoral and naked.</p><p id="90e3" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mw mx gd mz b gx na nb nc ha nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns fw bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">God, on the other hand, <em class="my">did</em> know the difference between right and wrong, and yet he used fear and lies to manipulate Adam and Eve. He wanted to prevent them from becoming moral beings, and when he got caught in his scheming, he went into a rage, and took it out on literally <em class="my">everyone</em> else.</p><p id="fb68" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mw mx gd mz b gx na nb nc ha nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns fw bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">This is awful, abusive behavior, even before we consider that God is supposedly all-knowing and all-powerful.

It is the serpent, who told the truth at enormous personal cost, and so allowed Eve and Adam to live morally good lives.</p><p id="2994" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mw mx gd mz b gx na nb nc ha nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns fw bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Unfortunately, serpents don’t write holy texts, so we will never know hisss side of the story.</p><h1 id="8808" class="nu nv gd bf nw nx ny gz nz oa ob hc oc od oe of og oh oi oj ok ol om on oo op bk" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="al">Unreasonable reactions</strong></h1><p id="7889" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mw mx gd mz b gx oq nb nc ha or ne nf ng os ni nj nk ot nm nn no ou nq nr ns fw bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Unfortunately, this chapter is not the only place in Genesis where God’s behavior deserves a second look.</p><p id="d93d" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mw mx gd mz b gx na nb nc ha nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns fw bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">There’s the part where he sends a flood to drown almost every single person, and almost <em class="my">every single animal</em>, because people were wicked. Wicked <em class="my">how</em>, you ask? That’s not exactly clear. The text doesn’t provide a lot of examples or details, just <a class="af nt" href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/GEN.6.1" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">a word salad about someone marrying whomever they want (gasp!), and about giants walking the earth</a>. Also, we can’t check, because God looked inside everyone’s heart, and we should just trust him when he tells us what he saw there.</p><p id="7d73" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mw mx gd mz b gx na nb nc ha nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns fw bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">We’re only getting God’s very sparse, own version of critical facts leading up to the flood and Noah’s Ark, but even those warrant asking some questions: Was that really a reasonable reaction?

Killing not just people, but otters and ostriches and baby hedgehogs — not quickly and painlessly in their sleep, but in a dramatic, global cataclysm that lasts for weeks.

Reading the mundane passages and descriptions before and between the most shocking acts or events, it may be challenging to keep in mind that we’re only getting one, skewed perspective, designed to shape our understanding.

The only thing we can be sure of, is that they want to affect us in some way. (Otherwise, why write anything at all?) And so we should bring the same critical judgement to everything we read, as we do to American Psycho, and when something violates every moral principle you hold, you don’t have to accept it as good or normal — even if it is presented as such.</p><p id="7d7b" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mw mx gd mz b gx na nb nc ha nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns fw bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">So, I return to my question: Do we really know that the God of Genesis is the good guy?
