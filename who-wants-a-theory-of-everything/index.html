Stuff no one else has good answers to, like “why is there something rather than nothing?” and “where does consciousness come from?”</p><p id="938f" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ms mt gd mu b gx mv mw mx ha my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn fw bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">First, however, I’ll go through the basics, so you’ll understand how I get to my conclusion.</p><p id="1fe5" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ms mt gd mu b gx mv mw mx ha my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn fw bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">What can we know and how we can know it?

Many of them you have probably heard about, but you may or may not have thought deeply about them. Other ideas may be new to you. Either way, they are fun to wrestle with, whether or not they’re correct.</p><p id="6bf6" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ms mt gd mu b gx mv mw mx ha my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn fw bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">It just so happens that I believe I discovered the answer to life, the universe and everything along the way. By skimming the popcultural versions of the greatest ideas in the history of thought, and playing with them, I answered some of the hardest questions in philosophy to my own satifaction — even as everyone from The Buddha to Einstein, Confucius to Lawrence Krauss, Socrates to Nick Bostrom failed. And I’ll tell you how I got there.</p><p id="fa6b" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ms mt gd mu b gx mv mw mx ha my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn fw bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">But the goal is less interesting than how I got there, in my opnion.

They’ll believe preposterous things. They’ll even admit that their beliefs are nearly impossible to accept for critical thinkers. And yet, if you give them a path out — a perfectly logical explanation to replace the seemingly unbelievable one they nevertheless believe in — they won’t take it.</p><p id="398e" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ms mt gd mu b gx mv mw mx ha my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn fw bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">If someone believes that the story of The Garden of Eden is literally true, they won’t even entertain the idea that the apple and the walking, talking snake, not to mention Eve and Adam themselves, might just be useful metaphors.</p><p id="f14d" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ms mt gd mu b gx mv mw mx ha my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn fw bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Once they’ve found enough evidence that the Earth is flat and the moon landing was faked, neither direct observation nor hundreds of years of coherent science is enough to change their mind back.</p><p id="3bf5" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ms mt gd mu b gx mv mw mx ha my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn fw bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Or if they learned in medical school that ulcers are caused by stress, otherwise science-minded doctors will resist alternative explanations for the longest time — even as their younger colleagues use the new explanation to cure ulcers, and the Nobel Institute awards its prize for the discovery. Facts and reasoning are not the issue.</p><p id="18f7" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ms mt gd mu b gx mv mw mx ha my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn fw bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Most people don’t care all that much about being right. They’d rather be certain. Which is not the worst impulse, really. In daily life, doubt, uncertainty and hesitation are costly.

It’s that these big questions have been stuck in my mind, like stones in my shoe, for as long as I can remember.
