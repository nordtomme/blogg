But if you follow along — maybe subscribe and follow — I promise that I’ll eventually get to everything you ever wanted a simple answer to. Stuff no one else has good answers to, like “why is there something rather than nothing?” and “where does consciousness come from?”</p><p id="938f" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ms mt gd mu b gx mv mw mx ha my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn fw bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">First, however, I’ll go through the basics, so you’ll understand how I get to my conclusion.</p><p id="1fe5" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ms mt gd mu b gx mv mw mx ha my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn fw bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">What can we know and how we can know it?

By skimming the popcultural versions of the greatest ideas in the history of thought, and playing with them, I answered some of the hardest questions in philosophy to my own satifaction — even as everyone from The Buddha to Einstein, Confucius to Lawrence Krauss, Socrates to Nick Bostrom failed. And I’ll tell you how I got there.</p><p id="fa6b" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ms mt gd mu b gx mv mw mx ha my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn fw bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">But the goal is less interesting than how I got there, in my opnion.

They’ll believe preposterous things. They’ll even admit that their beliefs are nearly impossible to accept for critical thinkers. And yet, if you give them a path out — a perfectly logical explanation to replace the seemingly unbelievable one they nevertheless believe in — they won’t take it.</p><p id="398e" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ms mt gd mu b gx mv mw mx ha my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn fw bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">If someone believes that the story of The Garden of Eden is literally true, they won’t even entertain the idea that the apple and the walking, talking snake, not to mention Eve and Adam themselves, might just be useful metaphors.</p><p id="f14d" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ms mt gd mu b gx mv mw mx ha my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn fw bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Once they’ve found enough evidence that the Earth is flat and the moon landing was faked, neither direct observation nor hundreds of years of coherent science is enough to change their mind back.</p><p id="3bf5" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ms mt gd mu b gx mv mw mx ha my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn fw bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Or if they learned in medical school that ulcers are caused by stress, otherwise science-minded doctors will resist alternative explanations for the longest time — even as their younger colleagues use the new explanation to cure ulcers, and the Nobel Institute awards its prize for the discovery.

This would have gone a lot better if I had known more about, well… everything. From quantum physics to neuroscience, theology to psychology, philosophy to biology. It would have been nice, and it would undoubtedly have helped.
