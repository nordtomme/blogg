If so, you’re almost certainly wrong, but at least you know your Douglas Adams¹. And you will also know what his imaginary supercomputer, Deep Thought, pointed out: The answer to life, the universe and everything is meaningless if you don’t know what the question is.</p>\n<p id=\"8522\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">It’s a good point: Knowing the right questions to ask is a great place to start making sense of the Universe.</p>\n<p id=\"70a7\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">What, then, is the question to the answer to life, the universe and everything? After thinking about this for more than 30 years, I have finally figured it out.</p>\n<p id=\"3a52\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Unfortunately and unsurprisingly, 42 makes absolutely no sense as the answer. Even more unsurprising: Going through the answer’s full and profound implications for the entire cosmos, and how it allows us to understand everything from morality to myth, from AI alignment to career choices, from consciousness to quantum entaglement, will require more than one post.</p>\n<p id=\"9521\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">So this post is just about the question, not the answer. Bummer, I know. But let’s take baby steps, and get the fundamentals in place, and we’ll get there eventually.</p>\n<p id=\"d97f\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">The real question to the answer to life, the universe and everything is …</p>\n<p id=\"54fb\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">(drumroll, please)</p>\n<p id=\"b9d2\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">“What can this possibly mean …?”</p>\n<p id=\"d77d\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">(ba-da-kish! i.e. cymbal)</p>\n<p id=\"a600\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Yes, I know!

The secrets of the Universe aren’t embroidered into the fabric of reality in casual English (or Hebrew, Greek, Arabic, Sanskrit, or astrology for that matter). So, the phrasing is all mine, but I have chosen it for reasons we’ll get into.</p>\n<p id=\"466e\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Once you get behind the words, however, you’ll discover that the question and its answers reveal something about the universe that runs all the way down.</p>\n<p id=\"a705\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">But first, a little background.</p>\n<p id=\"3056\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">It shouldn’t come as news to anyone that certain questions unlock the secrets of the universe. It has been common sense forever, but most of us haven’t taken in the full implications, or thought too hard about how to pose the right questions.</p>\n<p id=\"8567\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Back in the day of togas and hallucinogenic wine, one big question they thought might crack open the cosmos and allow us to look inside was “Why?”</p>\n<p id=\"f08f\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">“Why did that happen?”</p>\n<p id=\"5b0f\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">And like attention-hungry five-year-olds, they were never quite satisfied with the first answer they got. There would be follow-up questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b21f\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">“… but why does it do that?”</p>\n<p id=\"a437\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">“… and why is it like that?”</p>\n<p id=\"878e\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">It was a very effective little question to ask. Until they broke it.</p>\n<p id=\"45d6\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">I blame Aristotle for that. In fairness, he really only articulated beliefs that were quite wide-spread, but I prefer blaming the messenger.</p>\n<h1 id=\"e27a\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Overthinking chickens and roads</h1>\n<p id=\"cc2e\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">If you asked Aristotle “why did the chicken cross the road?”, he might give you a bunch of different answers:</p>\n<p id=\"44db\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Because chickens are living, walking, flesh-and-blood beings. And because the road was flat and crossable. And because the chicken was moving. And also to get to the other side.</p>\n<p id=\"f74a\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">As Aristotle saw it, there are four different types of causes, or answers to the question “Why?”:</p>\n<ul>\n<li id=\"a350\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">There’s the material cause, which is what something is made of. Chickens are living, walking, flesh and blood beings. If anything is going to cross a road, a living, walking, flesh and blood being is a really good candidate.</li>\n<li id=\"665f\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">There’s the formal cause, which is the form it takes. The road was flat, crossable, and in the chicken’s way. If “the road” had been a fifty-foot tower, ten miles away, the chicken probably wouldn’t have crossed it.</li>\n<li id=\"ea83\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">There’s the efficient cause, which is the action taken. The chicken was moving, presumably walking, in a particular direction. Walking is very high up on the list of actions that will cause chickens to cross roads.</li>\n<li id=\"a100\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">And then, there’s the so-called final cause. To get to the other side. This particular chicken had a purpose, and it was going after it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p id=\"1f7f\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">I won’t argue with you if you want to make the case that Aristotle was overthinking things a tiny little bit. But overthinking is my jam, so bear with us.</p>\n<p id=\"cdc3\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">The big problem is with that last cause. The final cause. The idea that things happen in order to fulfill a purpose, can really confuse things.</p>\n<p id=\"4bb1\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">It’s not a crazy idea. Chickens, like people, can be motivated by some purpose, like finding food. And if you ask a person why they did something, you are asking about their motivations and expectations.²</p>\n<p id=\"0948\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Aristotle, however, alludes to something more than just human or animal motivation. Again, not entirely crazy. It’s easy to see how someone might think an acorn’s purpose is to fall to the ground and sprout a new tree. Considering that Aristotle didn’t know how acorns evolved, it must have seemed as though the acorn (or whoever made it) “knew” what it some day had to do, and prepared for the task with its purpose in mind.</p>\n<p id=\"32e1\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">It’s possible to take this a bit too far, however. If a rock rolls down a hill, it was its purpose to be at the bottom of the hill. It is the fire’s purpose to consume wood, and the water’s purpose to put the fire out.</p>\n<p id=\"234c\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Aristotle conceded that some things may happen accidentally, without a purpose, but it was too little too late. Besides, not everyone was Aristotle. Most people just thought “everything happens for a reason,” and by “reason” they often meant so that something else that hasn’t yet happened might happen, for some other reason that also hasn’t yet happened.</p>\n<h1 id=\"b274\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">God’s master plan</h1>\n<p id=\"e2bc\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">The problem is that once we ascribe something a lot like goals to inanimate objects, and once we explain how things in the past were somehow caused by things that haven’t yet happened, it becomes really hard to follow the plot and figure stuff out. The idea of cause and effect gets confused, and the arrow of time is bent out of shape.</p>\n<p id=\"977e\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">You’d be excused if you thought that smart people would catch on to this problem quickly. Except they didn’t. Centuries passed while people accepted fate and destiny, whims of the gods, and some unknown meaning of life, as perfectly valid explanations for why anything happened.</p>\n<p id=\"6a86\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">It didn’t help that the Catholic church got really into this line of thinking. They loved the idea that everything happens in accordance with God’s mysterious master plan, and that He has mapped out every step on our journey to the apocalypse.</p>\n<p id=\"d4be\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">To this day, people will look at disasters and say “everything happens for a reason” in the sense that God is okay with letting children suffer and die in agonizing pain because he’s making a special omelet and has to break a few eggs. It’s all part of his perverted recipe, in which His ends justify His mysterious ways.</p>\n<p id=\"64b1\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">It’s a repulsive idea, yet common among good people. If you dare question it to the wrong people, you’re a heretic. And if you’re a heretic at the wrong time or place, you might burn or get you head chopped off.</p>\n<h1 id=\"f855\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Stupid questions</h1>\n<p id=\"6e3e\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">For a while there, giving good answers to good questions fell out of favor, as people got into the habit of torturing, burning, or otherwise ruining the lives of people who wondered whether God was sober, in control, and on track with his grand plan.</p>\n<p id=\"07ac\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">People still wanted to understand the world and unlock the universe’s secrets, however, so they didn’t stop asking questions — just good questions. One of the major scientific accomplishments of this era, was to establish definitively that there is, in fact, such thing as a stupid question.</p>\n<p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Finding the answer to the big questions of the cosmos, is a bit like trying to disassemble furniture in the dark. We may not know exactly where to start or what we’re doing, but we can tell that we have the right tool when the screws start coming out. In the same way that a Phillips-head screwdriver is near useless on those little Allen screws that IKEA uses, and risks ruining the screws, so some questions don’t get us any closer to the truth, but actually risk making us dumber.</p>\n<p id=\"130d\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">The old caricature of useless questions is “How many angels can dance on the head of a pin?” No one ever posed that particular question seriously, I think, but it is based on all-too-real questions that real thinkers spent time pondering. Like sainted philosopher Thomas Aquinas wondering whether several angels can be in the same physical place at the same time, or the longstanding question (we’re talking centuries of debate) of whether demons feel sexual desire.</p>\n<figure class=\"mz na nb nc nd mq mw mx paragraph-image\">\n<div class=\"ng nh ee ni bh nj\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\">\n<div class=\"mw mx oz\"><figure class=\"bh la nk c\"><source srcset=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/0*oegRdtm7PHMkRJw6.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/0*oegRdtm7PHMkRJw6.png 720w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/format:webp/0*oegRdtm7PHMkRJw6.png 750w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:786/format:webp/0*oegRdtm7PHMkRJw6.png 786w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/0*oegRdtm7PHMkRJw6.png 828w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/format:webp/0*oegRdtm7PHMkRJw6.png 1100w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/0*oegRdtm7PHMkRJw6.png 1400w\" sizes=\"(min-resolution: 4dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 4) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (min-resolution: 3dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 67vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3) and (max-width: 700px) 65vw, (min-resolution: 2.5dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2.5) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" type=\"image/webp\"><source data-testid=\"og\" srcset=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/0*oegRdtm7PHMkRJw6.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/0*oegRdtm7PHMkRJw6.png 720w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/0*oegRdtm7PHMkRJw6.png 750w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:786/0*oegRdtm7PHMkRJw6.png 786w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/0*oegRdtm7PHMkRJw6.png 828w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/0*oegRdtm7PHMkRJw6.png 1100w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/0*oegRdtm7PHMkRJw6.png 1400w\" sizes=\"(min-resolution: 4dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 4) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (min-resolution: 3dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 67vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3) and (max-width: 700px) 65vw, (min-resolution: 2.5dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2.5) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"><img  role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/0*oegRdtm7PHMkRJw6.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"137\" loading=\"lazy\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></picture></div>\n</div>\n<figcaption class=\"nl nm nn mw mx no np bf b bg z dx\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">“The Discovery of DNA Eluding Two Angels” by Rafael.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p id=\"11f2\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Even if there existed a way to purge the question of unfounded assumptions and get definitive answers, those answers wouldn’t get us anywhere we want to go. When it comes to getting to the bottom of the big issues of the universe, they’re precisely as useful as Harry Potter fan fiction. Not all inquisitiveness is equally productive.</p>\n<p id=\"0777\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">And so, it took the better part of two thousand years from Aristotle articulated his final cause, until anyone in the Christian world could say anything out loud and get away with it.</p>\n<h1 id=\"118e\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Finally: New rules</h1>\n<p id=\"ca62\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Toward the end of the 16th century, literal Renaissance men, like Galileo Galilei and Francis Bacon, proposed some new rules.</p>\n<p id=\"e4d3\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">As far as science is concerned, they suggested, cause and effect only works in one direction. If a rock has some higher purpose — things to do and places to be — that’s beyond the scope of what we can hope to find out, much less prove scientifically. When we want to explain why, oh why something happens in nature, we should rely on what we can observe, reproduce, and predict.</p>\n<p id=\"300c\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">It’s a good idea. Unfortunately, changing the world is a slow business.</p>\n<p id=\"e04d\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Many people embraced the new rules, which in time became known as the scientific method. But even today, no less than four centuries after Bacon, many people make a living (some make a killing) answering the big “Why?” questions the old-fashioned way: With reference to a higher will and cosmic goals we can only guess at.</p>\n<p id=\"588e\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">“Why?” would be a great question if we could only agree on what it means, and what counts as an answer. But since we obviously can’t agree, I thought I’d put some new words to the question behind the reality of it all.</p>\n<p id=\"a4fc\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">I don’t expect Gallileo ever used my words, but I’m sure the feeling swirled around his mind, and around all other great minds that have helped humanity throughout the history of ideas: “What can this possibly mean …?”</p>\n<h1 id=\"5fe2\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">The screws come loose</h1>\n<p id=\"0aa0\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">So what’s the deal with that question?</p>\n<p id=\"147a\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Like “Why?”, “What can this possibly mean …?” pokes at causality, and asks us to consider everything that brought us to a specific moment (in the sense “How could this have happened?”). But it also opens the situation up onto the future (in the sense “What might this lead to?”), without assuming any grand plan or purpose.³</p>\n<p id=\"9d6a\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">There are more reasons why I put the question that particular way, and I’ll get back to some of them in later posts, but the important thing to notice, is how it maps on to the universe: Getting the answers right allows us to predict the future, describe parts of the cosmos we’ve never seen, and create machines that do things our ancestors didn’t think were possible.</p>\n<p id=\"39bf\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">This may seem obvious and trivial to you, but if it does, you don’t appreciate how profound this is. When we ask and answer certain kinds of question — and only certain kinds — we get access to the secrets of the cosmos.</p>\n<p id=\"929f\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">When we start with observations of the world around us (rather than with assumptions about supernatural beings) … And when we go looking for mechanisms that make sense of the cause and effect (rather than assume that there’s some inscrutable, invisible hand at work) … And when we apply math and logic to problems (rather than faith) … And when we look closely at this world, and ask “What can this possibly mean?”… Only then do the screws start coming loose.</p>\n<p id=\"8e5c\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">We can tell the screws are coming loose, because the answers allow us to do things with the universe we couldn’t do before: send people into space and back; save the lives of people with AIDS or brain tumors; travel faster than sound, access virtually all art and knowledge in the world from our pocket, and tell a joke that is instantly heard by millions of people around the world.</p>\n<p id=\"7fe9\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">This is not about scientism, or some fetishization of the material world. (I promise to disappoint materialists later.) It’s a recognition of the kinds of questions that actually allow us to change life, the universe, and everything.</p>\n<figure class=\"mz na nb nc nd mq mw mx paragraph-image\">\n<div class=\"ng nh ee ni bh nj\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\">\n<div class=\"mw mx oz\"><figure class=\"bh la nk c\"><source srcset=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/0*4ctq_S33hLZSxFQH.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/0*4ctq_S33hLZSxFQH.png 720w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/format:webp/0*4ctq_S33hLZSxFQH.png 750w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:786/format:webp/0*4ctq_S33hLZSxFQH.png 786w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/0*4ctq_S33hLZSxFQH.png 828w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/format:webp/0*4ctq_S33hLZSxFQH.png 1100w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/0*4ctq_S33hLZSxFQH.png 1400w\" sizes=\"(min-resolution: 4dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 4) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (min-resolution: 3dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 67vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3) and (max-width: 700px) 65vw, (min-resolution: 2.5dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2.5) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" type=\"image/webp\"><source data-testid=\"og\" srcset=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/0*4ctq_S33hLZSxFQH.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/0*4ctq_S33hLZSxFQH.png 720w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/0*4ctq_S33hLZSxFQH.png 750w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:786/0*4ctq_S33hLZSxFQH.png 786w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/0*4ctq_S33hLZSxFQH.png 828w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/0*4ctq_S33hLZSxFQH.png 1100w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/0*4ctq_S33hLZSxFQH.png 1400w\" sizes=\"(min-resolution: 4dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 4) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (min-resolution: 3dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 67vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3) and (max-width: 700px) 65vw, (min-resolution: 2.5dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2.5) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"><img  role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/0*4ctq_S33hLZSxFQH.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"137\" loading=\"lazy\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></picture></div>\n</div>\n<figcaption class=\"nl nm nn mw mx no np bf b bg z dx\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Take away the presumption of demons and destiny, and everything still runs like clockwork …</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p id=\"14be\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">There is no amount of information about the sex life of demons that will enable you to travel 70 miles per hour while listening to the world’s best musicians.

It’s about giving regular citizens a voice, and there are more ways to do that than asking them to choose between two career whiners on a stage.</p>\n<p id=\"28de\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ms mt gd mu b gx mv mw mx ha my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn fw bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">It may seem strange to us now, but senators, both in the ancient Roman Republic and in the early United States, weren’t elected, but appointed (albeit by elected officials). This led to a lot of corruption and a lack of democratic accountability, so it’s hardly a system we want to return to, but it’s a reminder that there’s more than one way to pick a representative.</p>\n<p id=\"3101\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ms mt gd mu b gx mv mw mx ha my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn fw bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Another example comes from the ancient Athenians, who are often considered O.G.s of western democracy. They rarely elected their public officials. Instead they used a process called sortition, which was little more than a lottery that picked representatives at random from the eligible class. The job of government was broken down into small, manageable tasks and run by committees of about 10 such officials, picked at random.</p>\n<p id=\"999b\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ms mt gd mu b gx mv mw mx ha my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn fw bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Again, I’m not suggesting we copy that system. Not least because ancient Athens was a city state, with a population roughly 1/20,000th the size of the U.S, and an area a bit more than half the size of Rhode Island.</p>\n<p id=\"1e83\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ms mt gd mu b gx mv mw mx ha my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn fw bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">For that same reason, democracy was also more direct and more local in ancient Athens than in the U.S. today. People actively debated and voted on issues that typically had very direct impact on their lives, in their town. Society, government, technology, diplomacy …. Despite all their inherent complexity, none of these things appeared nearly so complex as they do today. It was only natural, then, to be both informed and engaged.</p>\n<p id=\"d273\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ms mt gd mu b gx mv mw mx ha my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn fw bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">If the ancient Greeks had to have sophisticated opinions on fracking in an area thousands of miles away, technology that none of them understood, or a war on the other side of the globe, their democracy might not have looked like such a role model for later civilizations.</p>\n<p id=\"b58d\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ms mt gd mu b gx mv mw mx ha my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn fw bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">But maybe we can take some inspiration?

That, at least is the spirit of these ideas.</p>\n<h1 id=\"0bfe\" class=\"np nq gd bf nr ns nt gz nu nv nw hc nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe of og oh oi oj ok bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><strong class=\"al\">Issues, not people, first</strong></h1>\n<p id=\"b517\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ms mt gd mu b gx ol mw mx ha om mz na nb on nd ne nf oo nh ni nj op nl nm nn fw bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">One lesson might be about making democracy primarily about prioritizing ideas and issues, not people.</p>\n<p id=\"3c96\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ms mt gd mu b gx mv mw mx ha my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn fw bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Instead of picking from a list of people each year, imagine if we were asked to prioritize from a list of issues.

There could be two ways to vote / prioritize:</p>\n<p id=\"d87e\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ms mt gd mu b gx mv mw mx ha my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn fw bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">90 percent of people would probably prefer the easy way, where you just sort issues into the order they concern you. E.g. Health care on first; Immigration policy second; Infrastructure → Local → Upgrade Post Road on third; Economy → Fiscal responsibility fourth, etc. You don’t have to have an opinion on every, or even many issues. You can pick just one issue if you want, or you can choose as many as you wish — so long as you put them in prioritized order.</p>\n<p id=\"a751\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ms mt gd mu b gx mv mw mx ha my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn fw bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">You don’t even have to know which level or branch of government is responsible for fixing your favorite issue, or have strong opinions on how to solve the issues. It’s not as though we really need voters to explain <em class=\"no\">how</em> they believe healthcare or immigration is broken. The general outline of the problem is usually quite obvious to insiders and experts — it’s coming up with a good solution that’s the problem. And while voters may have different ideas about the best way to solve it, the truth is that at least 95 percent of us have no clue! We know nothing substantive about the economics of public health, or the practicalities of maintaining a border, and we’re not <em class=\"no\">that</em> interested in the details. We just want competent people to create systems that work.</p>\n<p id=\"fde9\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ms mt gd mu b gx mv mw mx ha my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn fw bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">However, there should be ways for wonky people with special interests to go deep, if they wish. If you’re a voter who doesn’t shy away from a bit of complexity, you can take more fine-grained control of your ballot. For example, by distributing 1000 points among issues, sub-divided into near tactical priorities, so as to weight and prioritize them. (E.g. 300 points to “Health care → Single payer → Swedish model”; 178 points to “Gun rights → 2A protection”; 50 points each to “Economy → Job creation” and “Economy → Tax reduction → No tax on tips”; and so on, own the ballot.)</p>\n<p id=\"6adc\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ms mt gd mu b gx mv mw mx ha my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn fw bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">The key here is prioritization. Good priorities are absolutely essential for managing effectively, and pretty soon voters will probably get pretty good at thinking in terms of priorities, instead of just high expectations.</p>\n<p id=\"8c00\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ms mt gd mu b gx mv mw mx ha my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn fw bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Initially, the list of issues on the ballot should reflect the organization of government, e.g. the cabinet or the committees in the legislature. But we would have mechanisms by which new issues are added, for example through courts, lower-level governments, citizen initiatives, and write-ins. And issues with little interest should be slowly purged from the list.</p>\n<p id=\"26a5\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ms mt gd mu b gx mv mw mx ha my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn fw bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">One additional point: As with your tax return, submitting a ballot should be mandatory (though you can leave it blank if you wish). And also like your tax return, it should be largely confidential, but not entirely secret. The reasons for that will become clear in the next step.</p>\n<p id=\"df03\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ms mt gd mu b gx mv mw mx ha my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn fw bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">This list of priorities, accumulated for all citizens, should produce a complete, prioritized list of issues, that should work as a guiding light for the officials chosen to govern.</p>\n<h1 id=\"a289\" class=\"np nq gd bf nr ns nt gz nu nv nw hc nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe of og oh oi oj ok bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><strong class=\"al\">A Nomination Committee</strong></h1>\n<p id=\"79d8\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ms mt gd mu b gx ol mw mx ha om mz na nb on nd ne nf oo nh ni nj op nl nm nn fw bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">The next challenge, then, would be to select the people we need to execute our list of priorities.

For local elections, the requirements might be that they are 25 years or older, with a high school diploma or GED, and have submitted a ballot in the last three elections.</p>\n<p id=\"30d6\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ms mt gd mu b gx mv mw mx ha my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn fw bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">I say <em class=\"no\">virtually</em> at random, because it’s an important job that requires some basic qualifications. And it might also make sense to slightly weight the selection, so that people with views that align with the median voter have a higher chance of being selected for the committee, than people with more extreme views.</p>\n<p id=\"0d9b\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ms mt gd mu b gx mv mw mx ha my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn fw bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">For state and federal elections, we might also want to limit the selection pool to people who have successfully served at least one term on a local committee, or have some other relevant record of public service, so they have shown that they are up for the job.</p>\n<p id=\"49d9\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ms mt gd mu b gx mv mw mx ha my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn fw bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Once picked for the nomination committee, there’s a quick vetting process — for health, mental health, criminal record, national security, etc. — with clear and transparent criteria for disqualification. You can also apply for dispensation, if you believe serving will be to your serious detriment. Other than that, serving is mandatory (like jury duty or the draft), but it’s also a well-compensated privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"179a\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ms mt gd mu b gx mv mw mx ha my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn fw bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">And then the nomiantion system gets to work: They select, recruit and vet a handful of candidates for each office, to make sure the people on the ballot aren’t just the kind of thirsty masochists who self-select to run for office in our current system.</p>\n<h1 id=\"6258\" class=\"np nq gd bf nr ns nt gz nu nv nw hc nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe of og oh oi oj ok bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><strong class=\"al\">Everyone has a chance</strong></h1>\n<p id=\"1f47\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ms mt gd mu b gx ol mw mx ha om mz na nb on nd ne nf oo nh ni nj op nl nm nn fw bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Now, you might think this seems undemocratic — that a small group of people should select who we can even vote for. But that is largely what happens today anyway. The major difference is that the committee is (semi-)randomly selected from the entire qualifying population, and is far more likely to be representative of the people, than the small clique of party elites, wealthy donors, and media insiders who pick the candidates in our current system.</p>\n<p id=\"49b6\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ms mt gd mu b gx mv mw mx ha my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn fw bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">It’s worth noting that in this proposed system, everyone still has the opportunity to run for office, but it is much harder to game the system. Anyone, including incumbents who have not reached their term limit, can apply to the committee to be considered for a place on the ballot, but they are in no way guaranteed one, and it would be stupid to bet one’s career on believing otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b98b\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ms mt gd mu b gx mv mw mx ha my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn fw bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Additionally, committee members are expected to seek out and actively recruit highly-qualified candidates.</p>\n<p id=\"5be5\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ms mt gd mu b gx mv mw mx ha my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn fw bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">For example, when finding candidates for city council, they might look at local business people, activists, or school principals, and either nominate those people or ask them for recommendations. A successful mayor might be a good nominee for governor, and a successful governor or cabinet member might be a good candidate for president, even if they haven’t applied.</p>\n<p id=\"7867\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ms mt gd mu b gx mv mw mx ha my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn fw bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">The nomination committee also has the voters’ list of priorities, and see potential candidates’ prior issue ballots (with their permission, of course), and takes that into consideration when vetting suitable candidates. So if your priorities diverge too much from those of your neighbors, you are unlikely to be a good candidate, but if your views represent a moderate compromise between extremes or a representation of the common opinion, your chances increase drastically.</p>\n<p id=\"9dee\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ms mt gd mu b gx mv mw mx ha my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn fw bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Add to that, people whose stated priorities align closely with that of the population as a whole, should be algorithmically encouraged to apply at an appropriate level. So the restauranteur and the social media manager and the bank teller who in the last election revealed priorities that almost exactly align with the priorities of their town, are encouraged to apply to serve in public office at the local and regional level, which might put them on the radar for future nomination committees for other offices.</p>\n<p id=\"30f2\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ms mt gd mu b gx mv mw mx ha my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn fw bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Other guidelines for the committee include being skeptical of anyone who seems to be campaigning too actively before the slate is announced; considering track record and not automatically nominating incumbents; weighing political experience against non-political; considering experience at the relevant scale of organization and leadership; thinking about representation that mirrors the population, and trying to create a varied slate of qualified candidates considering all those variables.</p>\n<p id=\"1c4a\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ms mt gd mu b gx mv mw mx ha my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn fw bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Obviously, the committee can’t force anyone to run for office, but because the system has been entriely revamped, running no longer requires the same investment of time, money and reputation, nor the same network of wealthy donors, as it does today. That should lower the bar to entry significantly, and make it easier to accept.</p>\n<h1 id=\"b9f4\" class=\"np nq gd bf nr ns nt gz nu nv nw hc nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe of og oh oi oj ok bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><strong class=\"al\">How to get elected</strong></h1>\n<p id=\"ed0d\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ms mt gd mu b gx ol mw mx ha om mz na nb on nd ne nf oo nh ni nj op nl nm nn fw bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">A good committee will consider that there should be somewhat different criteria for executive roles, like mayor, governor or president, than for members of various councils and assemblies. Ultimately, it has to be about ability to do the job of governing effectively in accordance with the will of the people.</p>\n<p id=\"4051\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ms mt gd mu b gx mv mw mx ha my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn fw bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">The best way for someone to get into political office, then, is not to spend too much energy getting into a political office, but to share the values of your community, and do such a good job in your current position, that you are noticed and nominated by a committee of your peers.</p>\n<p id=\"d00e\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ms mt gd mu b gx mv mw mx ha my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn fw bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">At the end of the nomination process, the committee has gone through a hopefully large applicant pool, selected and vetted candidates, and narrowed it down to a reasonably varied slate of four to six qualified candidates for each office in their mandate. There is no such thing as a perfect candidate, of course, but the committee will have tried to identify candidates’ weaknesses, quirks or controversial opinions, and balanced that out in other candidates, so that people can choose their trade-offs.</p>\n<p id=\"39f5\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ms mt gd mu b gx mv mw mx ha my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn fw bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">The final candidates are officially announced eight weeks before the election, along with a prepared dossier for each, that includes the candidate’s background and experience, and priorities from previous years’ ballots. Maybe we even help each candidate record a well-prepared video, in a format that is as standard and recognizable as a TED talk, where they can present themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"a037\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ms mt gd mu b gx mv mw mx ha my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn fw bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">The candidate then has eight weeks to promote themselves as best they can and will, and the media has eight weeks to do their job of interviewing each candidate on a range of issues and views, before Election Day, when the voters use ranked choice voting to pick their favorites.</p>\n<h1 id=\"b805\" class=\"np nq gd bf nr ns nt gz nu nv nw hc nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe of og oh oi oj ok bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><strong class=\"al\">Improvements over the status quo</strong></h1>\n<p id=\"2a3b\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ms mt gd mu b gx ol mw mx ha om mz na nb on nd ne nf oo nh ni nj op nl nm nn fw bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">If this works as expected, choosing who to vote for would no longer be a question of party politics (political parties may still have a role in society, but a much smaller one), nor of choosing the lesser of two evils (extreme and radical candidates have all been filtered out early in the process). It will not be about money and outspending the competition to the same degree (there’s not much time to raise or spend money).</p>\n<p id=\"f9c5\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ms mt gd mu b gx mv mw mx ha my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn fw bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Instead, you will have to choose your preferred candidates based on how you judge their competence, character, charisma, and core values, as well as their opinion on the issues that matter most to you.</p>\n<p id=\"5dae\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ms mt gd mu b gx mv mw mx ha my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn fw bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">However, even controversial single issues will probably play a smaller part. Because of how they are selected, the candidates may disagree on issues, but will rarely be at opposite extremes. They are all more likely to have nuanced, “common-sensical” positions — some more liberal, some more conservative. And since representatives no longer rely so heavily on political parties for their careers and support, political factions will be looser, and it will be easier for individual representatives to vote their conscience on the issues, as opposed to voting along party lines. Besides, they will know what the mandate from the voters is, and be well-informed about their voters’ priorities.</p>\n<p id=\"7cd4\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ms mt gd mu b gx mv mw mx ha my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn fw bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Lobbying will still be important, but people’s political careers will typically be shorter, and more clearly guided by values and priorities. That will change the economics of influence, and there will be more to gain by persuading the electorate itself, rather than individual representatives, so as to increase the number of people who agree with you.</p>\n<p id=\"dc8d\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ms mt gd mu b gx mv mw mx ha my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn fw bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">That way you can change people’s priorities, as well as increase the likelihood that the nominees and the people on the nomination committee agree with you.

For simple tasks and clients you know well, one first draft may be enough. Otherwise, two different directions should do. Sometimes you need to show a third way, or a synthesis of the two others, but never show more than three. If you need more, you haven’t asked enough questions. Pick up the phone.</li>\n<li id=\"435c\" class=\"mo mp gx mq b hr oo ms mt hu op mv mw mx oq mz na nb or nd ne nf os nh ni nj ol om on bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">When you provide options, make them <em class=\"ot\">significantly</em> different. Not just different text alignment, a few centimeters change in position, or 4 pt larger font size. Change the entire idea, including the copy, purpose and function of the design. Force the client to consider the big, important questions: “What is the purpose of this?” and “Who am I?”, not small questions, like “should this be less pink?”</li>\n<li id=\"1aff\" class=\"mo mp gx mq b hr oo ms mt hu op mv mw mx oq mz na nb or nd ne nf os nh ni nj ol om on bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">When you have a strong preference about what the best option is, don’t provide other (necessarily worse) options. Instead, question your assumptions, and make better alternatives, until your preference is no longer quite so strong.</li>\n<li id=\"f377\" class=\"mo mp gx mq b hr oo ms mt hu op mv mw mx oq mz na nb or nd ne nf os nh ni nj ol om on bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">When you don’t have a strong opinion, make a decision anyway. That’s part of the job. But don’t try too hard to defend it if your client doesn’t like it. Instead, ask and listen to what the client says, so you learn how to make the decision the next time.</li>\n<li id=\"6505\" class=\"mo mp gx mq b hr oo ms mt hu op mv mw mx oq mz na nb or nd ne nf os nh ni nj ol om on bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Listen to the client, even when you think (know?) you are right. The client may be off about design and solutions, but they are usually right about their feelings and objectives. If they think something is wrong, it probably is – just not necessarily what they think it is.</li>\n<li id=\"388a\" class=\"mo mp gx mq b hr oo ms mt hu op mv mw mx oq mz na nb or nd ne nf os nh ni nj ol om on bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Prepare to defend your big choices, and your core idea, but don’t spend any time or energy defending choices you don’t actually care about. (Sounds obvious, but pride has a way of picking unnecessary fights.) The better your core idea and execution, the easier this gets.</li>\n<li id=\"88f7\" class=\"mo mp gx mq b hr oo ms mt hu op mv mw mx oq mz na nb or nd ne nf os nh ni nj ol om on bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">It is always possible to edit more, so never be surprised or disappointed if you are asked to make another change. Consequently: Never, ever name a file “final version”, because it almost never is. And never ask for opinions on work you consider finished, because you will get them.</li>\n<li id=\"bfa8\" class=\"mo mp gx mq b hr oo ms mt hu op mv mw mx oq mz na nb or nd ne nf os nh ni nj ol om on bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">When you think you’re finished, don’t ask. Let people know: “This looks really good now. I think we’re done.”</li>\n</ul>",

(“When a man sells his daughter as a slave …” begins <a class=\"af od\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+21%3A7-11&amp;version=NIV\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Exodus 21:7</a> matter-of-factly, going on to explain how that should work.)</p>\n<p id=\"2242\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph mg mh gd mi b gx mj mk ml ha mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb fw bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">I’m sure you agree that many of God’s rules and punishments are too cruel, such as putting someone to death for gathering sticks on the sabbath (<a class=\"af od\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers+15%3A32-36&amp;version=NIV\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Numbers 15:32–36</a>).
