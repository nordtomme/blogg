Most tags surround sections of content like this:</p>\n<p><code><tag>content content content</tag></code></p>\n<p>Notice that it begins and ends with the same word in brackets. Also, notice that the closing tag has a slash (“/”) before the word. The slash indicates closing.</p>\n<p>Often there is more information in the tag, like so:\n<code><tag class=“this that and the other thing” id=“identify” blah=“blah”>Content content content</tag></code></p>\n<p>Notice that the extra info only goes in the opening tag.</p>\n<p>Some tags don’t surround anything, but stand alone. If they do, they should end with a slash, like this:</p>\n<p><code><tag /></code>\nor like this if there is more info:\n<code><tag class=“this that and the other thing” id=“identify” blah=“blah” /></code></p>\n<p>Different tags mean different things. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n \t\n<li><code>\n<p></code> means that the content between the tags is a paragraph.</li>\n<li><code><br></code> signifies a line break</li>\n<li><code><a href=\"\"></code> is used to make links.</li>\n<li><code><strong></code> and <code><em></code> are different ways to emphasize content. Most often <code><strong></code> means bold, and <code><em></code> means italic text.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n… and so on. So:</p>\n<blockquote><code>\n<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, <strong>consectetur adipiscing elit</strong>. Proin eu ipsum justo, a consequat ligula. Mauris lectus dolor, vehicula in ultricies in, sollicitudin eget nulla. <em>Etiam quam elit, dapibus eget adipiscing sed, aliquam id eros.</em> Maecenas pulvinar hendrerit augue porta egestas.</p>\n<p>Ut ultricies arcu vel nunc dignissim egestas. Cum sociis natoque penatibus et magnis dis parturient montes, nascetur ridiculus mus.</p>\n<p></code></blockquote>\n<p>\n… should look something like this…</p>\n<blockquote>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, <strong>consectetur adipiscing elit</strong>. Proin eu ipsum justo, a consequat ligula. Mauris lectus dolor, vehicula in ultricies in, sollicitudin eget nulla. <em>Etiam quam elit, dapibus eget adipiscing sed, aliquam id eros.</em> Maecenas pulvinar hendrerit augue porta egestas.</p>\n<p>Ut ultricies arcu vel nunc dignissim egestas. Cum sociis natoque penatibus et magnis dis parturient montes, nascetur ridiculus mus.</blockquote>\n<p>\nThere’s a lot more to HTML than that, but I think that’s more than you need to know to be able to cut and paste code without screwing up.</p>\n<p>The most common beginners' mistake is probably to leave out either a closing tag (<code></tag></code>) or a closing quotation mark inside a tag (<code>class=\"right here\"</code>). If something looks terribly wrong after you've cut and pasted, or tried to tweak something, check those two things first.</p>\n<p>If you <em>do</em> want to learn more, I recommend <a href=\"http://www.codecademy.com/learn/web\" target=\"_blank\">Codecademy</a> and <a href=\"http://www.htmldog.com/\" target=\"_blank\">HTML Dog</a> (which is where I learned). You can probably make a simple website in a weekend with what you learn there.</p>\n",
