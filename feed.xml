                <p>Supposedly our educational system is designed for the Industrial Age; churning out people who can read a job description and will do as they’re told.</p>
<p>I just listened to <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/freakonomics-radio/id354668519?mt=2&i=351839891" target="_blank">this Freakonomics episode about using Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</a> (much more exciting than its name) to lower crime and dropout rates in Chicago Schools:</p>
<p>It’s very interesting, and got me thinking: If we are educating people who will mostly be working with their minds and interpersonal skills, then learning about how our own minds work – with regards to motivation, learning, habits, productivity & procrastination, empathy, creativity, etc. – should be a much more important part of our education on every level.</p>
<p>On every level, K through 12 and then some, kids should receive some kind of practical psychological education. Like gym class (if gym class were better), but for the brain.</p>

<p>You don’t need to know HTML to do that, but it helps to understand how it works, so you know which parts you should be copying and pasting where, and how to fix small things that go wrong.</p>
<p>So, here’s a super quick tutorial to help you understand what you’re looking at.</p>

<p>HTML is made up of so-called “tags”. Most tags surround sections of content like this:</p>
<p><code><tag>content content content</tag></code></p>
<p>Notice that it begins and ends with the same word in brackets. Also, notice that the closing tag has a slash (“/”) before the word. The slash indicates closing.</p>
<p>Often there is more information in the tag, like so:
<code><tag class=“this that and the other thing” id=“identify” blah=“blah”>Content content content</tag></code></p>
<p>Notice that the extra info only goes in the opening tag.</p>
<p>Some tags don’t surround anything, but stand alone. If they do, they should end with a slash, like this:</p>
<p><code><tag /></code>
or like this if there is more info:
<code><tag class=“this that and the other thing” id=“identify” blah=“blah” /></code></p>
<p>Different tags mean different things. For example:</p>
<ul>
 	
<li><code>
<p></code> means that the content between the tags is a paragraph.</li>
<li><code><br></code> signifies a line break</li>
<li><code><a href=""></code> is used to make links.</li>
<li><code><strong></code> and <code><em></code> are different ways to emphasize content. Most often <code><strong></code> means bold, and <code><em></code> means italic text.</li>
</ul>
<p>
… and so on. So:</p>
<blockquote><code>
<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, <strong>consectetur adipiscing elit</strong>. Proin eu ipsum justo, a consequat ligula. Mauris lectus dolor, vehicula in ultricies in, sollicitudin eget nulla. <em>Etiam quam elit, dapibus eget adipiscing sed, aliquam id eros.</em> Maecenas pulvinar hendrerit augue porta egestas.</p>
<p>Ut ultricies arcu vel nunc dignissim egestas. Cum sociis natoque penatibus et magnis dis parturient montes, nascetur ridiculus mus.</p>
<p></code></blockquote>
<p>
… should look something like this…</p>
<blockquote>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, <strong>consectetur adipiscing elit</strong>. Proin eu ipsum justo, a consequat ligula. Mauris lectus dolor, vehicula in ultricies in, sollicitudin eget nulla. <em>Etiam quam elit, dapibus eget adipiscing sed, aliquam id eros.</em> Maecenas pulvinar hendrerit augue porta egestas.</p>
<p>Ut ultricies arcu vel nunc dignissim egestas. Cum sociis natoque penatibus et magnis dis parturient montes, nascetur ridiculus mus.</blockquote>
<p>
There’s a lot more to HTML than that, but I think that’s more than you need to know to be able to cut and paste code without screwing up.</p>
<p>The most common beginners' mistake is probably to leave out either a closing tag (<code></tag></code>) or a closing quotation mark inside a tag (<code>class="right here"</code>). If something looks terribly wrong after you've cut and pasted, or tried to tweak something, check those two things first.</p>
<p>If you <em>do</em> want to learn more, I recommend <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/learn/web" target="_blank">Codecademy</a> and <a href="http://www.htmldog.com/" target="_blank">HTML Dog</a> (which is where I learned). You can probably make a simple website in a weekend with what you learn there.</p>

With the exception of spaces for sports, they are rarely designed for creation, without some over-arching commercial interest. <br><br>It seems like artistic, entertaining, informational and small-scale commercial activities in public spaces often happen despite and around the design of the space, not thanks to it. </span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">What if we built more places designed for ordinary people to perform, work, practice, build, teach, talk, trade, construct, experiment … Would we do those things?</span></p>

<div><strong>How to build awareness?</strong></div>
<div>Here is one technique for how I can become aware of how fast I speak, even if I can’t always keep it top of mind:</div>
<div>
<ul>
 	
<li>Listen to people speaking, e.g. talk radio, Ted talks</li>
<li>Make an effort to notice <em>speed and</em> <em>energy</em>.</li>
<li>Calibrate my mind to categorize and instantly recognize:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	
<li>low speed + high energy</li>
<li>high speed + high energy</li>
<li>low speed + low energy</li>
<li>high-speed + low energy</li>
<li>Notice the impact each has on me.</li>
<li>Recognizing the category and recognizing the impact – in others and myself – will become two cues that trigger awareness.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div><strong>How to practice actually speaking more slowly:</strong></div>
<div>
<ul>
 	
<li><em>Don’t</em> practice on family or close friends and colleagues. They know me, read me and understand me, and will think I am acting weird.</li>
<li>Instead, practice with new people (or speaking to groups). That can become a cue in itself: Meeting new people triggers awareness. My own theory, based on that, is that I’ll get disproportionate results from simply rehearsing a few slow introductions: <em>Hi ____, I’m Christian. It is nice to meet you.</em></li>
<li>In order to remember to keep the pace down, tap out a slow, relaxed beat. I’ve downloaded a metronome to my phone, which will be offscreen at my next Hangout, blinking at 35-40 bpm.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Other advice includes:</p>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
 	
<li>Actually listen to my own words (through my ears, not inside my head).</li>
<li>Picture my words leaving my mouth, travelling through the air, and being heard by the listener.</li>
<li>And, of course, record myself – but who <em>really</em> does that?</li>
</ul>
<p>
About 18 hours and two new meetings in, at least the technique for awareness seems to give results. We’ll see…</p>
